# AgriNova

## AgriNova is a mobile app that helps women farmers sell crops directly, find transport, and share farming knowledge with other farmers.



I added production-ready Mongoose models for User, Product, Ride, ForumPost and Comment in the project root:

- `backend_models_user.js` - User schema with profile, role enum, password hashing (bcrypt) and indexes.
- `backend_models_product.js` - Product schema with farmer ref, images, text indexes and timestamps.
- `backend_models_ride.js` - Ride schema for ride-sharing with driver ref and passengers.
- `backend_models_forumpost.js` - ForumPost schema with category enum and text search.
- `backend_models_comment.js` - Comment schema referencing ForumPost and User.
- `backend_models_index.js` - Central exporter to `require('./backend_models_index')`.

Quick setup to try the require-only test (does not connect to DB):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\MSI\Desktop\AgriNova-main
npm install
node backend_models_require_test.js
```

Notes:
- The project `backend_package.json` lists `mongoose` and `bcrypt`. If you use a different package for hashing (e.g. `bcryptjs`) update `backend_models_user.js` accordingly.
- To use the models in your app, import from the index:

```js
const { User, Product, Ride, ForumPost, Comment } = require('./backend_models_index');
```

Frontend (React) notes:

- The frontend uses TailwindCSS classes and an Axios helper at `frontend_src_api.js`. Set the API base URL via `REACT_APP_API_URL` in your `.env` for the client.
- To run the frontend (from project root):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\MSI\Desktop\AgriNova-main
# if using create-react-app style scripts in frontend_package_Version1.json, run the appropriate command, e.g.:
npm run start # or check frontend package.json scripts
```

If you use the same repository root for server and client, ensure client requests go to the correct API base (e.g. http://localhost:5000).
